Why Redis?
Redis is mainly used for caching.
Redis is fast, unlike other database which stores the data in hard drive, Redis stores the data
in memory.
Also, in redis, data in organized in a simple data structures like linked list, hash maps, sorted set.
It is simple in nature. (no much features like transactions, foreign keys etc)
